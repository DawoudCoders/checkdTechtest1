Steps to run:

1)in terminal run npm i

2)in terminal run npm start

3)app should open in browser

Things to note :

I had some problems getting jest set up and running on my end so didn't get time to complete testing etc I've written a few to show what kind of process I would take

Was pressed for time so the CSS / BarInfographic may not be the cleanest code - ability to refactor

As instructed I've kept styling to a minimum (no responsiveness, briefly followed layout etc)

Would love to talk about what I ran out of time with / what can be refactored
